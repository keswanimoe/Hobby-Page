    <h3>My First Blog Post - 14/03/23</h3>
    <p class="blog">
      Sewing has always been something that I've been interested in, but I never had the chance to learn. 
      However, with the pandemic, I found myself with a lot of free time, so I decided to finally give it a try. 

      I purchased the Singer Simple 3223 machine second-hand from Facebook Marketplace and it was really easy to set up. 
      The machine came with an instruction manual, bobbins, needles and black thread. The manual walked me through how to thread the machine, wind a bobbin, and sew different stitches. 
      I read the manual few times to get the hang of things and then I was ready to start sewing!

      My first project was a simple tote bag made from canvas fabric which I bought from my local fabric store. 
      I used a pattern that I found online and supplemented this with some Youtube tutorials and it was a great beginner project because it only required straight stitching. 
      I was amazed at how quickly the machine sewed through the fabric and how easy it was to control the speed with the foot pedal.

      After finishing my tote bag, I was filled with pride! 
      I started browsing online for more sewing projects and found so many cool ideas. 
      I made a skirt, a dress, and even some throw pillows for my room. 
      Each project was a little more challenging than the last, but I felt confident in my ability to tackle them thanks to my trusty Singer machine.

      One thing I love about sewing is that it allows me to express my creativity and make something unique. 
      I can choose the fabric, the pattern, and the embellishments to make a one-of-a-kind piece. 
      Plus, sewing is a great way to reduce waste by upcycling old clothes or using fabric scraps.

      Sewing has allowed me to explore my creativity in a whole new way.
      Overall, I'm so happy that I decided to try sewing and I can't wait to continue my journey.
