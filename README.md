A personal Hobby Page project to refine my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills (and to show off that I can sew ;))

I worked on this independently, using resources online to supplement my understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In particular the w3 schools docs, 

https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp 
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp
https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp

You can view the Hobby Page here by the link in the 'About' section of this repo.
