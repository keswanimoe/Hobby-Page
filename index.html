    <h1>Sewing Sewing Sewing!</h1>
    <h4>
    This is my own personal Sewing page where I can talk about all things Sewing! 
    Starting out is hard but the staying consistent is key to becoming a good seamstress so I will be using this page as a person blog to monitor my progress
    I'll be posting about all my mini sewing milestones, any tutorials I'm interested by, any patterns I am thinking about following, fabric, new sewing equipment purchasesâ€¦ just about anything sewing related!
